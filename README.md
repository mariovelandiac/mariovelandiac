# Hi, I'm Mario! 👋


I'm a self-taught backend developer with node.js by day ☀️ and musician (bass player 🎸) by night 🌃.

I began my journey as a Chemical Engineer, but currently, I am oriented towards one of my passions: technology. Therefore, I could act as a website manager with Wordpress, and later specialize in backend development with Node.js
